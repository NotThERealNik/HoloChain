# **HoloChain**  
*3D Holographic Data Visualization Library for AR/VR Experiences*

## **Overview**
HoloChain is an open-source, web-based framework designed to visualize complex data structures in 3D holographic space. It allows developers, researchers, and data scientists to interact with data models through AR/VR devices, offering an innovative way to analyze and interpret large and multidimensional datasets.

This library supports interactive, real-time data visualization through gestures, voice commands, and multi-user collaboration in augmented reality, providing immersive data exploration tools for the future of data science.

## **Features**
- **3D Interactive Data Models:**  
  Visualize datasets as interactive holograms using AR/VR technology.
  
- **Real-Time Collaboration:**  
  Collaborate with multiple users in shared holographic spaces through WebRTC.

- **Time Series Visualization:**  
  Analyze time-based data in a dynamic 3D timeline that updates in real-time.

- **Voice and Gesture Control:**  
  Utilize hand gestures and voice commands to manipulate holographic data.

- **Multi-Platform Support:**  
  Works on desktop browsers and mobile devices with WebXR-enabled AR experiences.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js, Three.js for 3D rendering
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python (API-based)
- **AR/VR:** WebXR, Babylon.js for augmented reality rendering
- **Collaboration:** WebRTC for real-time user interaction
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow.js (or API for external ML models)

## **How to Get Started**
### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HoloChain.git
cd HoloChain
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. **Run the Project**
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### 4. **Build for Production**
```bash
npm run build
```

## **Usage**
- **HoloChart Component:**  
  The core component for rendering a simple 3D holographic cube:
  ```jsx
  import HoloChart from './components/HoloChart';
  <HoloChart />
  ```

## **Future Roadmap**
- Add advanced holographic visualizations (graphs, charts, neural networks).
- Extend voice/gesture control for more interactions.
- Support for machine learning model visualizations in 3D.
- Integration with major cloud data sources (AWS, Google Cloud).
